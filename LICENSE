LEGAL COMPLIANCE
================

17 U.S.C. § 1201(f) states:

"(f) Reverse Engineering.—

(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), a person who has
lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a computer program may circumvent
a technological measure that effectively controls access to a particular portion
of that program for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those elements
of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently
created computer program with other programs, and that have not previously been
readily available to the person engaging in the circumvention, to the extent any
such acts of identification and analysis do not constitute infringement under
this title or a violation of applicable law other than this section.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(2) and (b), a person may
develop and employ technological means to circumvent a technological measure, or
to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure, in order to enable
the identification and analysis under paragraph (1), or for the purpose of
enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other
programs, if such means are necessary to achieve such interoperability, to the
extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title."
